HONK! Fest West is partnering with CHOMP!

CHOMP! is a free event for local food, live music, green living workshops and activities for the whole family.

We're going to have a booth, where everyone is invited to come create instruments out of upcycled recyclables, fruits and veggies, which will be provided.

With our instruments in hand, we'll lead a parade around CHOMP! Everyone is welcome to join.

Come create instruments for your own band and play with us. It will be a blast!

*Free / All Ages*
