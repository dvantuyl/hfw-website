        <p>
          To bring such magic in the streets of our fair city, we are counting
          on all you fine folks to pitch in and give a warm welcome to these
          performers & the festival fans. HONK! Fest West is a nonprofit
          community street festival created by, for, and of the people, which
          means the festival is depending on the help of everyone who wants to
          see this radical party take to the streets!

          Volunteer shifts are short and negotiable, which leaves you plenty of
          time footloose and fancy free to enjoy the festivities! Volunteering
          comes in many varieties, each with its own perks and responsibilities.
          Whatever your interests, there’s a job for you! From housing the
          visiting bands, serving food to the hungry troops, and soliciting
          donations, there is something for everyone!

        <em>No Housing Needs fro 2021</em>
        <p>
          We have over 200 bands members visiting from out of town, and they
          will each need a place to rest and freshen up for a few nights.
          Hosting a band in your home is one of the best and most helpful ways
          to be involved with our community festival. While we can’t offer any
          compensation, we can guarantee that the <b>friendships</b> and
          <b>memories</b> you make with your guests will be treasured for years
          to come.

        </h2>
        <p>
          We are looking for some pavement pounders to help us get the word out
          among local businesses and residents. This task involves distributing
          posters, fliers, and information during one of several excursions, and
          ongoing promotion of the festival through word of mouth.

          <span class="ft-clr-1">Food / Hospitality</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We’re already receiving outstanding food support from local
          businesses, but with so many hungry musicians about, we’ll need a few
          extra hands helping us dish out the goods.

        <h2 class="ft-fml-1 ft-bdr-1 text-4xl mb-2"><span class="ft-clr-1">Staging</span></h2>
        <p>
          The staging crews are where the action (and the music!) is. As a
          staging volunteer, you’ll be helping folks maximize their enjoyment at
          one or more of the sets. Primary responsibilities include soliciting
          donations from the crowd, handing out schedules and maps, providing
          information, assisting bands with finding their stages, and running
          messages. We will also need a few volunteers to help direct the bands
          to their stages and make sure things stay on schedule. If you’re well
          organized and love music, let us know!
